# 🚀 OpenRouter: A Unified Interface for 50+ Free Large Language Models (LLMs)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an integral part of modern software development. With many AI providers emerging, developers face the challenge of managing multiple APIs and services. This is where OpenRouter shines — a unified platform that gives access to over 50 free and paid LLMs through a single, easy-to-use interface and API.

## 🔍 What is OpenRouter?

OpenRouter is a powerful platform that gives you access to 50+ advanced AI models from different companies — all through a single, simple API. Instead of learning and managing the separate APIs of OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Meta, and other open-source models, developers can use just one API via OpenRouter. This makes integration faster, easier, and more flexible.

It works like a hub or a middleman — you send your request to OpenRouter, and it forwards it to the model of your choice (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Mixtral, LLaMA, etc.) and returns the result to you.

## ✅ Example

Let’s say you built a chatbot. Normally, you’d have to choose one model, like OpenAI’s GPT-4, and stick with its pricing, limits, and API. But with OpenRouter, you can switch between GPT-4, Claude 3, or open-source models like Mistral or DeepSeek — without rewriting your code.

## 📜 History and Purpose

Before OpenRouter, AI developers had to juggle multiple APIs, each with its own documentation and quirks. OpenRouter was created in 2025 to solve this fragmentation by providing a single proxy API to access many models at once, reducing integration complexity and speeding up AI adoption.

## 🖥️ User Interface and Dashboard

OpenRouter features a clean, user-friendly dashboard that includes:

- A chatroom interface to test models interactively
- Account management tools such as API key generation, usage statistics, and billing information
- A playground for testing different prompts and models

## 🔗 API Compatibility

OpenRouter is fully compatible with OpenAI’s Chat Completion API. Developers can use their existing OpenAI code with minimal changes, mostly swapping out endpoints and keys, allowing for smooth migration or parallel usage.

## 🛠️ Function Calling Support

One of the standout features of OpenRouter is its support for function calling. This allows AI models to invoke external tools and APIs, such as calculators, weather services, or custom business logic, making AI-powered applications much more interactive and powerful.

## 📦 Model Hosting: Proxy or Host?

OpenRouter does not host models itself. Instead, it acts as a proxy, routing requests to various third-party AI providers. This reduces infrastructure overhead and allows users to access a broad selection of models from a single interface.

## 💰 Pricing Model and Token Usage

OpenRouter operates on a pay-per-use pricing model. Some models are completely free but come with usage limits, such as:

- 20 requests per minute
- 200 requests per day

Users can track usage and costs directly from their dashboard, allowing them to control spending effectively.

## ⏳ Rate Limits: OpenRouter vs Google Gemini

OpenRouter’s free tier has similar rate limits to Google Gemini’s free tier, ensuring fair usage across users. These limits maintain platform stability and guarantee availability for all users.

## 🚀 Installation

To set up the project using `uv`:

```bash
uv init --package
uv add openai==0.28
uv add python-dotenv
```

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
2. Add your OpenRouter API key to the `.env` file like this:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

3. Make sure your main file contains code that loads the environment and calls the OpenRouter API using the OpenAI library.

## ▶️ Usage

To run the project, use:

```bash
uv run your project name
```

The script will send a prompt to the OpenRouter API and print the model's response to the console.
